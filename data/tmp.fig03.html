Additionally the seabed \u00ab Carte G \u00bb from the French hydrographic survey (SHOM) was used in the interpretation process.\nIn the tidal zone the identification was made by interpreting coastal ortho-photographs from BD Ortho (2005 et 2009) and digitising them on scale 1 : 2000\u00e8me with further qualification of the polygons based on ground truth data.\nThe compilation comprises the following various data sources.\nLamarche S., Bajjouk T., 2013.

The second target set by Regulation 33 is to ensure that the distribution of characteristic chalk cliff biotopes, LR.FLR.CvOv.ChrHap, LR.FLR.Lic.Bli and LR.FLR.Lic.UloUro does not significantly decrease from the original baseline survey. This could not be assessed as none of these biotopes were present along the monitoring transects in the original or subsequent survey.  Recommendations for future surveying of the transects around Flamborough Head are; to have a consistent survey methodology for greater inter-survey comparability, more regular targeted surveying of transects where significant biotope change has occurred (i.e. Mytilus biotopes of transects 2, 4, and 9) incorporated within a less frequent comprehensive survey programme, and surveying to occur during late summer/early autumn when seaweeds are at greatest diversity."}, {"id": 790, "label": "13377ec5-7521-4065-ac34-8fc90ea20105", "shape": "dot", "title":

Additionally the seabed \u00ab Carte G \u00bb from the French hydrographic survey (SHOM) was used in the interpretation process.\nIn the tidal zone the identification was made by interpreting coastal ortho-photographs from BD Ortho (2005 et 2009) and digitising them on scale 1 : 2000\u00e8me with further qualification of the polygons based on ground truth data.\nA confidence score in the [0-100] scale has been assigned to each polygon (SUM_CONF field)\nThe compilation comprises the following various data sources.\nLamarche S., Bajjouk T., 2013.

For example, a cell of A3.1 high energy infralittoral rock with \u2018low\u2019 energy class confidence, \u2018moderate\u2019 biozone confidence and \u2018high\u2019 substrate type confidence would have an overall \u2018low\u2019 confidence. However, moving up the hierarchy to EUNIS level two (A3 infralittoral rock) removes the energy class; therefore, the confidence of the EUNIS level two habitat type would only consider the \u2018moderate\u2019 biozone confidence and \u2018high\u2019 substrate type confidence, resulting in an overall \u2018moderate\u2019 confidence.\n\nFor details on methodology see:\nPopulus J.

Surveys were carried out on foot where the intertidal area was small and/or firm underfoot and from a hovercraft where soft sediments were present. \n      \n     Target notes and photographs of visible flora and fauna were supplemented with 0.01m2 core samples consisting of five faunal replicates and a further one for particle size analysis (PSA), as well as 1m2 quadrats dug out to 20cm to aid biotope classification.  Samples were sieved at 0.5mm and all invertebrates enumerated and biomass estimated by wet weight by species. \n      \n     Chichester Harbour was characterised by mud habitats in the upper reaches with sand shores to the south of Thorney Island and near to the harbour mouth.  Algal mats were recorded in the upper reaches of the harbour, notably Bosham Channel, where seagrass was also present but extensive beds were only discovered recorded from the southwestern corner of the harbour.  Fauna in the muddy areas was dominated by oligochaetes and cirratulid polychaetes especially Tubificoides benedii and Tharyx killariensis as well as the small gastropod Hydrobia ulvae.  In sandy areas, the fauna was characterised by the lugworm Arenicola marina, the orbiniid polychaete Scoloplos armiger and tanaid crustaceans. \n      \n     Langstone Harbour was also characterised by mud habitats almost throughout the entire area but with some areas of coarse mixed sediment on the upper shore which supported a wide variety of macroalgae but which also showed signs of bait digging.  Algal mats were much more prevalent in Langstone Harbour than in Chichester Harbour but seagrass was also much more extensive.  The fauna of the samples from Langstone Harbour was very similar to that of Chichester Harbour with a numerical dominance of cirratulids, oligochaetes and Hydrobia ulvae. \n      \n     In Southampton Water, there was a greater mix of habitats from tide-swept coarse sediment to fine silt and clay.  The tide-swept gravels and pebble at the mouth of the Hamble Estuary supported a diverse assemblage of macroalgae and epifauna which included ascidians, barnacles, bivalves and sponges.  Within the Hamble Estuary itself, there were very soft fine sediments which supported cockles but there were also thick algal mats which supported large numbers of Hydrobia ulvae but caused anoxia at the mud surface.  Soft, fine sediments were also encountered on the western side of Southampton Water from Calshot to Hythe with a fauna dominated by Tharyx killariensis but with large numbers of cockles and Hydrobia ulvae near Calshot itself. \n      \n     On the seaward side of Calshot, to western side of the Beaulieu Estuary, there were coarse mixed sediments which supported ephemeral algae, small actiniarians, and a rich fauna of polychaetes, amphipods and molluscs.

Surveys were carried out on foot where the intertidal area was small and/or firm underfoot and from a hovercraft where soft sediments were present. \n      \n     Target notes and photographs of visible flora and fauna were supplemented with 0.01m2 core samples consisting of five faunal replicates and a further one for particle size analysis (PSA), as well as 1m2 quadrats dug out to 20cm to aid biotope classification.  Samples were sieved at 0.5mm and all invertebrates enumerated and biomass estimated by wet weight by species. \n      \n     Chichester Harbour was characterised by mud habitats in the upper reaches with sand shores to the south of Thorney Island and near to the harbour mouth.  Algal mats were recorded in the upper reaches of the harbour, notably Bosham Channel, where seagrass was also present but extensive beds were only discovered recorded from the southwestern corner of the harbour.  Fauna in the muddy areas was dominated by oligochaetes and cirratulid polychaetes especially Tubificoides benedii and Tharyx killariensis as well as the small gastropod Hydrobia ulvae.  In sandy areas, the fauna was characterised by the lugworm Arenicola marina, the orbiniid polychaete Scoloplos armiger and tanaid crustaceans. \n      \n     Langstone Harbour was also characterised by mud habitats almost throughout the entire area but with some areas of coarse mixed sediment on the upper shore which supported a wide variety of macroalgae but which also showed signs of bait digging.  Algal mats were much more prevalent in Langstone Harbour than in Chichester Harbour but seagrass was also much more extensive.  The fauna of the samples from Langstone Harbour was very similar to that of Chichester Harbour with a numerical dominance of cirratulids, oligochaetes and Hydrobia ulvae. \n      \n     In Southampton Water, there was a greater mix of habitats from tide-swept coarse sediment to fine silt and clay.  The tide-swept gravels and pebble at the mouth of the Hamble Estuary supported a diverse assemblage of macroalgae and epifauna which included ascidians, barnacles, bivalves and sponges.  Within the Hamble Estuary itself, there were very soft fine sediments which supported cockles but there were also thick algal mats which supported large numbers of Hydrobia ulvae but caused anoxia at the mud surface.  Soft, fine sediments were also encountered on the western side of Southampton Water from Calshot to Hythe with a fauna dominated by Tharyx killariensis but with large numbers of cockles and Hydrobia ulvae near Calshot itself. \n      \n     On the seaward side of Calshot, to western side of the Beaulieu Estuary, there were coarse mixed sediments which supported ephemeral algae, small actiniarians, and a rich fauna of polychaetes, amphipods and molluscs.  There was also a large seagrass bed on the lower shore at Calshot and evidence of bait digging in these areas, particularly at Lepe Beach.  Within the Beaulieu and Lymington Estuaries the habitats were fine, soft sediments with a similar fauna to the mud areas of Chichester and Langstone Harbours but with a greater prevalence of ragworm and tellins. \n      \n     The north coast of the Isle of Wight was characterised by protrusions of clay and outcrops of bedrock which supported piddocks and a rich crustacean fauna as well as a variety of macroalgae predominantly fucoids.

The map is a result of an integrated analysis of newly acquired and previously available acoustic data together with ground-truthing data collected by a dedicated survey of the sitein 2013. Habitat classes observed at each ground-truthing station were used to inform a semi-automated process of map production using object-based image analysis (OBIA). The map shows the seabed at the site to be characterised largely by \u2018A5.1 Subtidal coarse sediment\u2019 and \u2018A5.4 Subtidal mixed sediments\u2019, which are mapped together as a complex due to difficulty in separating the two from the underlying acoustic data. Smaller patches of \u2018A5.2 Subtidal sand\u2019 and \u2018A4.2 Moderate energy circalittoral rock\u2019 are also found within the site.\n\nA new habitat map for the Mid St Georges Channel Marine recommended Marine Conservation Zone (rMCZ) was produced by analysing and interpreting newly acquired and previously available acoustic data together with ground-truthing data collected by a dedicated survey of the site.  \n\nFull coverage multibeam echosounder (MBES) data covering 70% of the Mid St George\u2019s Channel rMCZ was collected in 2012 by Osiris Projects.  An additional block of full coverage MBES data was collected by RV Cefas Endeavour on CEND05/13, adding a further 5% area coverage of the site. The remaining 25% of the rMCZ has partial coverage (31%) MBES data collected under the Mid Irish Sea Project.  More detail on the acoustic data used, and references to the aquisitieon reports can be found in the Mid St Georges Channel Marine rMCZ Post-Survey Site Report (Defra Contract Reference: MB0129; Report Number 29)\n\nGround-truth sampling for the site was planned using a standard MCZ ground-truthing sampling grid, applied to different habitat types identified from the processed bathymetry and backscatter layers. Station positions were then modified to target features of interest, in particular suspected reef features. The survey was carried out between 1-6th May 2013 on the RV CEFAS Endeavour cruise CEND0513. Ground truth samples were collected from 130 stations.

Habitat classes observed at each ground-truthing station were used to inform a semi-automated process of map production using object-based image analysis (OBIA). The map shows the seabed at the site to be characterised largely by \u2018A5.1 Subtidal coarse sediment\u2019 and \u2018A5.4 Subtidal mixed sediments\u2019, which are mapped together as a complex due to difficulty in separating the two from the underlying acoustic data. Smaller patches of \u2018A5.2 Subtidal sand\u2019 and \u2018A4.2 Moderate energy circalittoral rock\u2019 are also found within the site.\n\nA new habitat map for the Mid St Georges Channel Marine recommended Marine Conservation Zone (rMCZ) was produced by analysing and interpreting newly acquired and previously available acoustic data together with ground-truthing data collected by a dedicated survey of the site.  \n\nFull coverage multibeam echosounder (MBES) data covering 70% of the Mid St George\u2019s Channel rMCZ was collected in 2012 by Osiris Projects.  An additional block of full coverage MBES data was collected by RV Cefas Endeavour on CEND05/13, adding a further 5% area coverage of the site. The remaining 25% of the rMCZ has partial coverage (31%) MBES data collected under the Mid Irish Sea Project.  More detail on the acoustic data used, and references to the aquisitieon reports can be found in the Mid St Georges Channel Marine rMCZ Post-Survey Site Report (Defra Contract Reference: MB0129; Report Number 29)\n\nGround-truth sampling for the site was planned using a standard MCZ ground-truthing sampling grid, applied to different habitat types identified from the processed bathymetry and backscatter layers. Station positions were then modified to target features of interest, in particular suspected reef features. The survey was carried out between 1-6th May 2013 on the RV CEFAS Endeavour cruise CEND0513. Ground truth samples were collected from 130 stations.

This study was supported by the INDEMARES-LIFE+ Project, EC contract INDEMARES-LIFE+ (07/NAT/E/000732): Inventory and Designation of the Natura 2000 network in marine areas of the Spanish State (www.indemares.es/en). This work was coordinated by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO, www.ieo.es) and the Biodiversity Foundation (www.fundacion-biodiversidad.es). The interpretation has been made possible thanks to direct and indirect samplings and geophysical data from campaigns INDEMARES_CHICA (CHICA0610, CHICA0211, CHICA1011 and CHICA0412). Habitats are classified according to EUNIS nomenclature and the List of Marine Habitats in Spain (LPRE, that it\u2019s classified hierarchically and was completed and published in March 2013)."}, {"id": 4180, "label": "VCMX", "shape": "dot", "title": "VCMX"}, {"id": 4181, "label": "Seabed Habitat (Habitat Directive) - FR2502021 \u0027Baie de Seine Orientale\u0027 (Cartham) - FR004015", "shape": "dot", "title": "Seabed Habitat (Habitat Directive) - FR2502021 \u0027Baie de Seine Orientale\u0027 (Cartham) - FR004015"}, {"id": 4182, "label": "8862aab3-67f1-4b43-bb11-fcaf2620f323", "shape": "dot", "title": "8862aab3-67f1-4b43-bb11-fcaf2620f323"}, {"id": 4183, "label": "The HABMAP project was set up in response to the need for better spatial awareness of habitat distributions in the Southern Irish Sea.
