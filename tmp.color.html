This was the second of three missions funded by NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR)/CPO/GOMO and NOAA/OMAO as a pilot study for the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS)-2020 project.

Mr. Nathan Anderson contributed to the metadata creation. PMEL TPOS 2018 Mission (aka Mission 2) had four Saildrones: SD1005 and SD1006 were Gen 4 drones, and SD1029 and SD1030 were Gen 5 drones equipped with a larger wing designed for equatorial work.  The drones were each equipped with full atmospheric and ocean core sensor suite, and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) (not included in this file). SD1029 and SD1030 also carried shortwave and longwave radiation (included in core set) and an ASVCO2 carbon flux and pH system; these carbon data are served in a separate file. SD1029 had 3 strap-on SBE56 temperature sensors (at 0.35m, 1.16m, and 1.72m) to study the near-surface stratification. For the Gen5 drones, the core Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) was an RBR located in the flowthrough tunnel in the keel.

After sailing near a PMEL Carbon mooring in Kaneohe Bay, HI, the drones proceeded to the Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean (TAO) mooring at 9N, 140W. Three drones completed a circuit around the mooring, and then began their transit south towards the equator. Two drones made it to the equator and sailed near the TAO moorings at 0, 140W.  Navigation issues caused the mission to be aborted early (mid-December 2018), before further science tasks could be completed. Three Saildrones were recovered in Honolulu on 01-27-19.

These points were used only as absences in macrophytes models, based on the knowledge that macrophytes do not live at such depths in the Baltic Sea due to habitat constraints and lack of light."}, {"id": 973, "label": "distance", "shape": "dot", "title": "distance"}, {"id": 974, "label": "non", "shape": "dot", "title": "non"}, {"id": 975, "label": "_:Nbb632f7ee94642558c9b64ec2cb03734", "shape": "dot", "title": "_:Nbb632f7ee94642558c9b64ec2cb03734"}, {"id": 976, "label": "F8D574AE-1EA3-4CA8-92BC-C115F3D784B0", "shape": "dot", "title": "F8D574AE-1EA3-4CA8-92BC-C115F3D784B0"}, {"id": 977, "label": "OCEAN WAVES", "shape": "dot", "title": "OCEAN WAVES"}, {"id": 978, "label": "_:Ncea10f83c988400c800e4da37e1874b8", "shape": "dot", "title": "_:Ncea10f83c988400c800e4da37e1874b8"}, {"id": 979, "label": "Marine habitat mapping within the GR2140003 Natura site (Paraktia Thalassia Zoni apo Parga eos Akrotirio Agios Thomas (Preveza), Akr.

The survey extends from Portland Bill in Dorset to Avonmouth in Bristol and includes the Isles of Scilly. The landward limit of the survey varied but in general is determined by one of the following: Extent of aerial photography;  Indicative tidal floodplain; Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs); Extent of coastal BAP habitats; 5m contour with a 200m landward buffer ; Inclusion of other target habitats.  The habitat map was originally created using the Integrated Habitat Survey (IHS) classification originally developed by Somerset Environmental Records Centre.

This 2019 Arctic Saildrone Mission was a joint effort betweenNOAA\ufffds Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), the NOAA/University of Washington Joint Institute for the Study of the Ocean and Atmosphere (Joint Institue for the Study of Atmoshere and Ocean (JISAO)), and the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) Arctic MISST (Multi-sensor Improved Sea Surface Temperature) study. The overall mission objective was to measure atmospheric, oceanographic, fishery and fur seal conditions in the US arctic. One USV (sd-1041) remained in the Bering Sea measuring fish acoustic backscatter and conducting focal follows of threatened fur seals for AFSC. Five saildrones transited Bering Strait into the Chukchi Sea. One of those (sd-1033) surveyed lines in Distributed Biological Observatories (DBO) 1-5. The remaining four (PMEL sd-1034, sd-1035 and MISST sd-1036, sd-1037) ran transects in the Chukchi Sea and approached the southern sea ice edge in the Arctic Ocean up to ~75\ufffdN to measure air-sea heat and momentum flux near sea ice and to validate satellite sea-surface temperature measurements in the arctic. Each saildrone was equipped to measure solar irradiance, air temperature and relative humidity, barometric pressure, surface skin temperature, wind speed and direction, wave height and period, seawater temperature and salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and dissolved oxygen. Four cameras aboard each USV imaged up, down, port and starboard of the wing. Saildrones sd-1033 and sd-1034 had Autonomous Surface Vehicle CO2 (ASVCO2) systems measuring seawater pH, temperature, salinity and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Vehicles sd-1033, sd-1034, sd-1035, sd-1036 and sd-1037 measured near surface currents with 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP). Sd-1041 carried Simrad WBT Mini and ES38-18/200-18C fisheries echosounders. There were about two dozen encounters with free-floating sea ice between the four Chukchi Sea/Arctic Ocean saildrones. Sd-1035 was caught in sea ice and rendered barely maneuverable with rudder damage about 24 August. Its mission ended early on 10 September after which it was towed into Point Barrow. The remaining saildrones sampled Bering Sea transects and returned to Dutch Harbor on 11 October after sailing side-by-side for a few hours on an end-of-mission comparison. Other supporting measurements were made during this mission. The PMEL/WHOI/JISAO Arctic Heat Open Science Experiment dropped AXBTs on 16-22 July. USCGC Healy met sd-1033 on 11 August for a pCO2 cross-calibration.

A number of survey lines at right angles to the break in slope were added to the along-escarpment line to better characterise features of interest observed on the 2005 multibeam echosounder dataset downslope of the escarpment.\nAdditionally several survey lines were located on the top of the bank, across an area of suspected iceberg ploughmarks."}, {"id": 4352, "label": "EP_GEO_INT_BGCP_AL_PP_GLO", "shape": "dot", "title": "EP_GEO_INT_BGCP_AL_PP_GLO"}, {"id": 4353, "label": "\npmelTaoDyIso\n", "shape": "dot", "title": "\npmelTaoDyIso\n"}, {"id": 4354, "label": "VAVT", "shape": "dot", "title": "VAVT"}, {"id": 4355, "label": "1c06ba1a-bd15-4a64-a01b-e5e0764ae49b", "shape": "dot", "title": "1c06ba1a-bd15-4a64-a01b-e5e0764ae49b"}, {"id": 4356, "label": "8a406060-5d24-45c5-841f-77b9ba690cb4", "shape": "dot", "title": "8a406060-5d24-45c5-841f-77b9ba690cb4"}, {"id": 4357, "label": "end", "shape": "dot", "title": "end"}, {"id": 4358, "label": "\npmelTaoDyBf\n", "shape": "dot", "title": "\npmelTaoDyBf\n"}, {"id": 4359, "label": "eurobis_points", "shape": "dot", "title": "eurobis_points"}, {"id": 4360, "label": "Mapping of the Natura 2000 site FR5300017 \"Abers - C\u00f4te des l\u00e9gendes\"  was jointly performed in the framework of three different actions: (i) the Natura 2000 convention for Brittany, and (iii) CARTHAM Project.\nIt is based on the interpretation of various types of data from a number of surveys carried out between 2005-2012 both in the intertidal and subtidal zones.

Data are available for viewing and download on EMODnet - Human Activities web portal (www.emodnet-humanactivities.eu). The database contains points representing shellfish farms or shellfish production areas (depending on available data) in the following countries: Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway and United Kingdom. Spanish data is provided separately through WMS services. Data is missing for Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Croatia and Slovenia. Except for Germany, the shellfish production remains limited in those MS. There is no production in other MS. Each point has the following attributes (where available): status (active, inactive), country, owner name, farm type (Mussels, Oysters, Mussels-Oysters, Clams, Specialised (other), Mixed (other)), production method (Long lines,  Trestles or trays, Tanks, Rafts, Beds, Raceways), production stage (Grow out for human consumption, Hatchery, Nursery, Broodstock, Reproduction,  Harvest, Other), purpose (Commercial, Research, Education, Display, Other), species detailed (English translation of the information provided on species grown or authorised in the source), point information (Polygon centroid, Original) depending on how the information is provided in the source (polygons or points), site_id,  distance to coast (metres), position from coastline (At sea, within the coastline).  The farm type relies on a typology established by AND-International, based on available information on species grown or authorised. A relational table provides harmonised information about species grown or authorised using Eurostat nomenclature for the Species Group (Mussels; Oysters;  Clams, cockles, arkshells;  Scallops, pectens;  Abalones, winkles, conchs;  Sea-urchins and other echinoderms) and when available the species name (e.g. Blue mussels - Mytilus edulis). The distance to coast (EEA coastline shapefile) has been calculated using the original data map projections, where available. In the other cases it was used the UTM WGS84 Zone projected coordinate system where data fall in. Compared with the previous version this new version has been not only updated but was also reviewed (dataset schema and attributes values), in order to add information on production methods, production stages and purposes and to provide a more useful typology based on species grown.

The database contains points representing shellfish farms or shellfish production areas (depending on available data) in the following countries: Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway and United Kingdom. Spanish data is provided separately through WMS services. Data is missing for Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Croatia and Slovenia. Except for Germany, the shellfish production remains limited in those MS. There is no production in other MS. Each point has the following attributes (where available): status (active, inactive), country, owner name, farm type (Mussels, Oysters, Mussels-Oysters, Clams, Specialised (other), Mixed (other)), production method (Long lines,  Trestles or trays, Tanks, Rafts, Beds, Raceways), production stage (Grow out for human consumption, Hatchery, Nursery, Broodstock, Reproduction,  Harvest, Other), purpose (Commercial, Research, Education, Display, Other), species detailed (English translation of the information provided on species grown or authorised in the source), point information (Polygon centroid, Original) depending on how the information is provided in the source (polygons or points), site_id,  distance to coast (metres), position from coastline (At sea, within the coastline).  The farm type relies on a typology established by AND-International, based on available information on species grown or authorised. A relational table provides harmonised information about species grown or authorised using Eurostat nomenclature for the Species Group (Mussels; Oysters;  Clams, cockles, arkshells;  Scallops, pectens;  Abalones, winkles, conchs;  Sea-urchins and other echinoderms) and when available the species name (e.g. Blue mussels - Mytilus edulis). The distance to coast (EEA coastline shapefile) has been calculated using the original data map projections, where available. In the other cases it was used the UTM WGS84 Zone projected coordinate system where data fall in. Compared with the previous version this new version has been not only updated but was also reviewed (dataset schema and attributes values), in order to add information on production methods, production stages and purposes and to provide a more useful typology based on species grown. Data from Norway and Bulgaria have been added. Data from France relies on cadastral data rather than large production areas in the previous database."}, {"id": 5630, "label": "a48a6529-346b-4cbc-934f-f6eec7ee9362", "shape": "dot", "title": "a48a6529-346b-4cbc-934f-f6eec7ee9362"}, {"id": 5631, "label": "40f1a7b4-eefd-41c2-bf53-a77bb136e02c", "shape": "dot", "title": "40f1a7b4-eefd-41c2-bf53-a77bb136e02c"}, {"id": 5632, "label": "2015-08-27", "shape": "dot", "title": "2015-08-27"}, {"id": 5633, "label": "\nShelikof_line8_3695_0ada_d066\n", "shape": "dot", "title": "\nShelikof_line8_3695_0ada_d066\n"}, {"id": 5634, "label": "\nIrregularTime2_9eee_c434_6efb\n", "shape": "dot", "title": "\nIrregularTime2_9eee_c434_6efb\n"}, {"id": 5635, "label": "KilkeeReefs_HD_DEF", "shape": "dot", "title": "KilkeeReefs_HD_DEF"}, {"id": 5636, "label": "surface_net_downward_longwave_flux", "shape": "dot", "title": "surface_net_downward_longwave_flux"}, {"id": 5637, "label": "EMODnet Physics - DB of the platforms collecting Wind parameters at ground/sea level in EMODnet Physics - Coordinates", "shape": "dot", "title": "EMODnet Physics - DB of the platforms collecting Wind parameters at ground/sea level in EMODnet Physics - Coordinates"}, {"id": 5638, "label": "DK003005_HabitatsDirectice_DEF", "shape": "dot", "title": "DK003005_HabitatsDirectice_DEF"}, {"id": 5639, "label": "c962fd3e-97a0-4aa1-bc53-7c59732676b6", "shape": "dot", "title": "c962fd3e-97a0-4aa1-bc53-7c59732676b6"}, {"id": 5640, "label": "EP_ERD_INT_NTAW_AL_PR_NRT", "shape": "dot", "title": "EP_ERD_INT_NTAW_AL_PR_NRT"}, {"id": 5641, "label": "\npmel_co2_moorings_1c20_dc17_edf5\n", "shape": "dot", "title": "\npmel_co2_moorings_1c20_dc17_edf5\n"}, {"id": 5642, "label": "2adf6c6e-85be-4eab-bd7c-b5067b1eb5e0", "shape": "dot", "title": "2adf6c6e-85be-4eab-bd7c-b5067b1eb5e0"}, {"id": 5643, "label": "\npmel_co2_moorings_79f4_6c5b_4880\n", "shape": "dot", "title": "\npmel_co2_moorings_79f4_6c5b_4880\n"}, {"id": 5644, "label": "Golfo de Vizcaya", "shape": "dot", "title": "Golfo de Vizcaya"}, {"id": 5645, "label": "7cb252f2-0593-4b62-9538-8de5e0f95a96", "shape": "dot", "title": "7cb252f2-0593-4b62-9538-8de5e0f95a96"}, {"id": 5646, "label": "d1c5b733-1e71-46a6-bd1d-2ac53665fdae", "shape": "dot", "title": "d1c5b733-1e71-46a6-bd1d-2ac53665fdae"}, {"id": 5647, "label": "Marine habitat mapping within the GR4220006 Natura site (Nisos Polyaigos - Kimolos)", "shape": "dot", "title": "Marine habitat mapping within the GR4220006 Natura site (Nisos Polyaigos - Kimolos)"}, {"id": 5648, "label": "c744b4c4-6ae3-4e7a-b610-67269bcc3382", "shape": "dot", "title": "c744b4c4-6ae3-4e7a-b610-67269bcc3382"}, {"id": 5649, "label": "Krieged BroadScale Substrate Map of South-west Deeps (West) rMCZ", "shape": "dot", "title": "Krieged BroadScale Substrate Map of South-west Deeps (West) rMCZ"}, {"id": 5650, "label": "Coarse rocky ground EUNIS seabed classification West of Greenland", "shape": "dot", "title": "Coarse rocky ground EUNIS seabed classification West of Greenland"}, {"id": 5651, "label": "mole_fraction_of_ozone_in_air", "shape": "dot", "title": "mole_fraction_of_ozone_in_air"}, {"id": 5652, "label": "\nThis dataset has daily Sensible Heat Flux data from the\nTAO/TRITON (Pacific Ocean, https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/gtmba/ ),\nRAMA (Indian Ocean, https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/gtmba/pmel-theme/indian-ocean-rama ), and\nPIRATA (Atlantic Ocean, https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/gtmba/pirata/ )\narrays of moored buoys which transmit oceanographic and meteorological data to shore in real-time via the Argos satellite system.

Fauna in the muddy areas was dominated by oligochaetes and cirratulid polychaetes especially Tubificoides benedii and Tharyx killariensis as well as the small gastropod Hydrobia ulvae.  In sandy areas, the fauna was characterised by the lugworm Arenicola marina, the orbiniid polychaete Scoloplos armiger and tanaid crustaceans. \n      \n     Langstone Harbour was also characterised by mud habitats almost throughout the entire area but with some areas of coarse mixed sediment on the upper shore which supported a wide variety of macroalgae but which also showed signs of bait digging.  Algal mats were much more prevalent in Langstone Harbour than in Chichester Harbour but seagrass was also much more extensive.  The fauna of the samples from Langstone Harbour was very similar to that of Chichester Harbour with a numerical dominance of cirratulids, oligochaetes and Hydrobia ulvae. \n      \n     In Southampton Water, there was a greater mix of habitats from tide-swept coarse sediment to fine silt and clay.  The tide-swept gravels and pebble at the mouth of the Hamble Estuary supported a diverse assemblage of macroalgae and epifauna which included ascidians, barnacles, bivalves and sponges.  Within the Hamble Estuary itself, there were very soft fine sediments which supported cockles but there were also thick algal mats which supported large numbers of Hydrobia ulvae but caused anoxia at the mud surface.  Soft, fine sediments were also encountered on the western side of Southampton Water from Calshot to Hythe with a fauna dominated by Tharyx killariensis but with large numbers of cockles and Hydrobia ulvae near Calshot itself. \n      \n     On the seaward side of Calshot, to western side of the Beaulieu Estuary, there were coarse mixed sediments which supported ephemeral algae, small actiniarians, and a rich fauna of polychaetes, amphipods and molluscs.  There was also a large seagrass bed on the lower shore at Calshot and evidence of bait digging in these areas, particularly at Lepe Beach.  Within the Beaulieu and Lymington Estuaries the habitats were fine, soft sediments with a similar fauna to the mud areas of Chichester and Langstone Harbours but with a greater prevalence of ragworm and tellins. \n      \n     The north coast of the Isle of Wight was characterised by protrusions of clay and outcrops of bedrock which supported piddocks and a rich crustacean fauna as well as a variety of macroalgae predominantly fucoids.  In addition, the habitats of Thorness Bay included mixed coarse sediment supporting barnacles and littorinids and sand supporting sand mason worms and small patches of seagrass beds.
