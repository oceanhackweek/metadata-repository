Samples were sieved at 0.5mm and all invertebrates enumerated and biomass estimated by wet weight by species. \n      \n     Chichester Harbour was characterised by mud habitats in the upper reaches with sand shores to the south of Thorney Island and near to the harbour mouth.  Algal mats were recorded in the upper reaches of the harbour, notably Bosham Channel, where seagrass was also present but extensive beds were only discovered recorded from the southwestern corner of the harbour.  Fauna in the muddy areas was dominated by oligochaetes and cirratulid polychaetes especially Tubificoides benedii and Tharyx killariensis as well as the small gastropod Hydrobia ulvae.  In sandy areas, the fauna was characterised by the lugworm Arenicola marina, the orbiniid polychaete Scoloplos armiger and tanaid crustaceans. \n      \n     Langstone Harbour was also characterised by mud habitats almost throughout the entire area but with some areas of coarse mixed sediment on the upper shore which supported a wide variety of macroalgae but which also showed signs of bait digging.  Algal mats were much more prevalent in Langstone Harbour than in Chichester Harbour but seagrass was also much more extensive.  The fauna of the samples from Langstone Harbour was very similar to that of Chichester Harbour with a numerical dominance of cirratulids, oligochaetes and Hydrobia ulvae. \n      \n     In Southampton Water, there was a greater mix of habitats from tide-swept coarse sediment to fine silt and clay.  The tide-swept gravels and pebble at the mouth of the Hamble Estuary supported a diverse assemblage of macroalgae and epifauna which included ascidians, barnacles, bivalves and sponges.  Within the Hamble Estuary itself, there were very soft fine sediments which supported cockles but there were also thick algal mats which supported large numbers of Hydrobia ulvae but caused anoxia at the mud surface.

The biotope distribution and species composition was developed through interpretation of drop-down video footage and digital still photography, taken after evaluation of the sidescan mosaic.  \n\nThe results of all elements of the survey were used to create a Geographical Information System (GIS) which enabled a high level of processing, interpretation and display of the sidescan sonar mosaic, bathymetry, substrata types, biotopes and the digital photography."}, {"id": 1862, "label": "salinity", "shape": "dot", "title": "salinity"}, {"id": 1863, "label": "07e7b408-f8fa-46ae-b0bc-5adadfea8d68", "shape": "dot", "title": "07e7b408-f8fa-46ae-b0bc-5adadfea8d68"}, {"id": 1864, "label": "_:N16d2c9f9d2234796990805768a88bbf1", "shape": "dot", "title": "_:N16d2c9f9d2234796990805768a88bbf1"}, {"id": 1865, "label": "cd2e1fdb-2709-4ea1-97d5-162c18d7ba1b", "shape": "dot", "title": "cd2e1fdb-2709-4ea1-97d5-162c18d7ba1b"}, {"id": 1866, "label": "This file shows the distribution of Annex 1 habitats - estauries, mudflats and sandflats not covered by sea water at low tide, coastal lagoons, reefs and large shallow inlets and bays - in the Tralee Bay SAC.

Maps show the upper limits and a number of different Posidonia meadows with distinction of different facies (i.e. Posidonia on rock, Posidona on sand, Posidonia on matte etc)."}, {"id": 2236, "label": "FR7200813 - COTE BASQUE ROCHEUSE ET SON EXTENSION AU LARGE.\nProduit issu du programme MESH ATLANTIC. \nR\u00e9alis\u00e9 par l\u0027IMA. \nHabitats : intertidal, infralittoral, circalittoral.\nEUNIS 2007\nNum\u00e9risation des habitats d\u0027apr\u00e8s les donn\u00e9es existantes, donn\u00e9es Vecteurs, polygones des habitats.\nSynth\u00e8se bibliographique, prospection terrain (multibeam)", "shape": "dot", "title": "FR7200813 - COTE BASQUE ROCHEUSE ET SON EXTENSION AU LARGE.\nProduit issu du programme MESH ATLANTIC. \nR\u00e9alis\u00e9 par l\u0027IMA. \nHabitats : intertidal, infralittoral, circalittoral.\nEUNIS 2007\nNum\u00e9risation des habitats d\u0027apr\u00e8s les donn\u00e9es existantes, donn\u00e9es Vecteurs, polygones des habitats.\nSynth\u00e8se bibliographique, prospection terrain (multibeam)"}, {"id": 2237, "label": "This shape lists the areas covered by the Regional Advisory Councils (RAC) as poligons as exposed in the Atlas of the Seas.

In its original form the map depicts six benthic communities including Phoronis. Since inthe new German Red List Biotope classification system Phoronis is dealt with in Level 6 corresponding areas were split and assigned by expert judgement to the Tellina-fabula and Amphiura-filiformis community."}, {"id": 2541, "label": "Data that contributed to the MB0102 Task 2I English intertidal habitats dataset.

The model was carried out in the projection UTM zone 33N. Kelp forest was defined as the dense kelp forest (see Bekkby et al. 2009), not the scattered occurrences. The model was developed based on 1170 data points and GAM analyses of presence and absence points (presence being kelp forest, absence being absence of kelp at all other densities). Data were collected 2007-2008 by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) and the Institute for Marine Research (IMR), the model was run in 2009 by NIVA. The distribution model is based on depth, slope, terrain curvature, wave exposure and median current speed, wave exposure being the far most important variable (see Bekkby et al. 2009 for explanation of the GIS environmental layers).

The model was developed based on 1170 data points and GAM analyses of presence and absence points (presence being kelp forest, absence being absence of kelp at all other densities). Data were collected 2007-2008 by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) and the Institute for Marine Research (IMR), the model was run in 2009 by NIVA.

Each point has the following attributes (where available): status (active, inactive), country, owner name, farm type (Mussels, Oysters, Mussels-Oysters, Clams, Specialised (other), Mixed (other)), production method (Long lines,  Trestles or trays, Tanks, Rafts, Beds, Raceways), production stage (Grow out for human consumption, Hatchery, Nursery, Broodstock, Reproduction,  Harvest, Other), purpose (Commercial, Research, Education, Display, Other), species detailed (English translation of the information provided on species grown or authorised in the source), point information (Polygon centroid, Original) depending on how the information is provided in the source (polygons or points), site_id,  distance to coast (metres), position from coastline (At sea, within the coastline).  The farm type relies on a typology established by AND-International, based on available information on species grown or authorised. A relational table provides harmonised information about species grown or authorised using Eurostat nomenclature for the Species Group (Mussels; Oysters;  Clams, cockles, arkshells;  Scallops, pectens;  Abalones, winkles, conchs;  Sea-urchins and other echinoderms) and when available the species name (e.g. Blue mussels - Mytilus edulis). The distance to coast (EEA coastline shapefile) has been calculated using the original data map projections, where available. In the other cases it was used the UTM WGS84 Zone projected coordinate system where data fall in. Compared with the previous version this new version has been not only updated but was also reviewed (dataset schema and attributes values), in order to add information on production methods, production stages and purposes and to provide a more useful typology based on species grown. Data from Norway and Bulgaria have been added. Data from France relies on cadastral data rather than large production areas in the previous database."}, {"id": 3639, "label": "d47990e9-c4f2-421e-8bac-fe3fc6099d16", "shape": "dot", "title": "d47990e9-c4f2-421e-8bac-fe3fc6099d16"}, {"id": 3640, "label": "a2661c90-c4e8-4595-8347-e150f28f269e", "shape": "dot", "title": "a2661c90-c4e8-4595-8347-e150f28f269e"}, {"id": 3641, "label": "Broadscale habitat (EUNIS level 3) for East of Celtic Deep recommended Marine Conservation Zone (rMCZ)", "shape": "dot", "title": "Broadscale habitat (EUNIS level 3) for East of Celtic Deep recommended Marine Conservation Zone (rMCZ)"}, {"id": 3642, "label": "EMODnet Physics - Collection of sound velocity (SVEL) TimeSeries - MultiPointTimeSeriesObservation", "shape": "dot", "title": "EMODnet Physics - Collection of sound velocity (SVEL) TimeSeries - MultiPointTimeSeriesObservation"}, {"id": 3643, "label": "eaa234b4-410d-4b61-9a49-43947814a8e0", "shape": "dot", "title": "eaa234b4-410d-4b61-9a49-43947814a8e0"}, {"id": 3644, "label": "2015 Natural England (NE) Shell Flat and Lune Deep Site of Community Importance (SCI) - Drop-Down Video Survey", "shape": "dot", "title": "2015 Natural England (NE) Shell Flat and Lune Deep Site of Community Importance (SCI) - Drop-Down Video Survey"}, {"id": 3645, "label": "BaldoyleBay_HD_DEF", "shape": "dot", "title": "BaldoyleBay_HD_DEF"}, {"id": 3646, "label": "The geodatabase with areas for aggregates extraction in the EU was created in 2018 by AZTI-Tecnalia for the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet).

Seabed Substrate (EMODnet Geology)\n2. Bathymetry (EMODnet Bathymetry)\n3. Light at the Seabed\n4. Wave Base (modeled)\n5. Wave energy (modelled)\n6. Current energy (modelled)\nThe model, produced in Arc Model Builder (10.1), uses datasets 2 to 4 to determine biological zone, which in combination with seabed substrate and energy data can be used to predict the physical habitat at any one location.\nThe study followed the methodology developped within the EUSeaMap 1 project. For more details about this methodology see documents such as the EUSeaMap 1 final report (Cameron and Askew, 2011), Coltman et al., 2008, or Vasquez et al., 2015\nThe model was created using raster input layers with a cell size of 0.002dd (roughly 250 meters). The model includes the sublittoral zone only; due to the high variability of the littoral zone, a lack of detailed substrate data and the resolution of the model, it is difficult to predict littoral habitats at this scale.\nThe map follows the EUNIS 2007-11 classification system, supplemented by additional categories in deep sea areas and in areas lacking full data.\n\nReferences:\nCameron, A., Askew, N.

EUSeaMap 2016, a coarser resolution** broad-scale habitat map, which covers all European seas (view/download on the EMODnet Seabed Habitats interactive map).\n\nBoth of these datasets have been created using identical methods; the only difference is in the resolution of the seabed substrate input data and the source and resolution of the depth data.\n\nClassification systems:\n    EUNIS habitat classification system, with additional deep sea zones\n    MSFD predominant habitats\n    The Marine Habitat Classification for Britain and Ireland\n \nInput data layers:\n    Seabed substrate type\n    Depth to the seabed\n    Amount of light reaching the seabed\n    Wave disturbance at the seabed\n    Kinetic energy at the seabed caused by tidal currents and waves\n \nOutputs:\n    Predictive seabed habitat map  \n    Confidence layers\n\nThe map follows the EUNIS 2007-11 classification system where it is appropriate."}, {"id": 4189, "label": "1D8074FE-49FB-4A60-9A9C-A54EBCF7CB53", "shape": "dot", "title": "1D8074FE-49FB-4A60-9A9C-A54EBCF7CB53"}, {"id": 4190, "label": "f438a07a-28c2-44c0-9d50-e3c4d633c304", "shape": "dot", "title": "f438a07a-28c2-44c0-9d50-e3c4d633c304"}, {"id": 4191, "label": "Buildings", "shape": "dot", "title": "Buildings"}, {"id": 4192, "label": "transport", "shape": "dot", "title": "transport"}, {"id": 4193, "label": "This file shows the distribution of the Annex 1 habitat mudflats and sandflats not covered by sea water at low tide in Donegal Bay SAC.
