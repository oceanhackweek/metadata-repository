This 2019 Arctic Saildrone Mission was a joint effort betweenNOAA\ufffds Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), the NOAA/University of Washington Joint Institute for the Study of the Ocean and Atmosphere (Joint Institue for the Study of Atmoshere and Ocean (JISAO)), and the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) Arctic MISST (Multi-sensor Improved Sea Surface Temperature) study. The overall mission objective was to measure atmospheric, oceanographic, fishery and fur seal conditions in the US arctic. One USV (sd-1041) remained in the Bering Sea measuring fish acoustic backscatter and conducting focal follows of threatened fur seals for AFSC. Five saildrones transited Bering Strait into the Chukchi Sea. One of those (sd-1033) surveyed lines in Distributed Biological Observatories (DBO) 1-5. The remaining four (PMEL sd-1034, sd-1035 and MISST sd-1036, sd-1037) ran transects in the Chukchi Sea and approached the southern sea ice edge in the Arctic Ocean up to ~75\ufffdN to measure air-sea heat and momentum flux near sea ice and to validate satellite sea-surface temperature measurements in the arctic. Each saildrone was equipped to measure solar irradiance, air temperature and relative humidity, barometric pressure, surface skin temperature, wind speed and direction, wave height and period, seawater temperature and salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and dissolved oxygen. Four cameras aboard each USV imaged up, down, port and starboard of the wing. Saildrones sd-1033 and sd-1034 had Autonomous Surface Vehicle CO2 (ASVCO2) systems measuring seawater pH, temperature, salinity and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Vehicles sd-1033, sd-1034, sd-1035, sd-1036 and sd-1037 measured near surface currents with 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP). Sd-1041 carried Simrad WBT Mini and ES38-18/200-18C fisheries echosounders. There were about two dozen encounters with free-floating sea ice between the four Chukchi Sea/Arctic Ocean saildrones. Sd-1035 was caught in sea ice and rendered barely maneuverable with rudder damage about 24 August. Its mission ended early on 10 September after which it was towed into Point Barrow. The remaining saildrones sampled Bering Sea transects and returned to Dutch Harbor on 11 October after sailing side-by-side for a few hours on an end-of-mission comparison. Other supporting measurements were made during this mission. The PMEL/WHOI/JISAO Arctic Heat Open Science Experiment dropped AXBTs on 16-22 July. USCGC Healy met sd-1033 on 11 August for a pCO2 cross-calibration. Sd-1034 and sd-1035 sailed near the sites of periodic surfacings of Marine Robotic Vehicles (MRV) Air-Launched Autonomous Micro-Observer (ALAMO) float 9234.

Full coverage biotope mapping was accomplishedby applying Random Forests on site specific data on six infaunacommunitiesand predictor data on e.g. topographical and sedimentological features of the sea floor for a 600 m x 600 m raster. The benthic communities had been derived from infauna abundance data by use of fuzzy clustering (for corresponding methodological details please refer to Fiorentino et al. 2017).

The model is run using the program WaveImpact based on the method \u201cSimplified Wave Model\u201d (SWM) developed and described by Is\u00e6us (2004). The method is a fetch model, where the fetch values are adjusted to simulate refraction and diffraction effects. The estimated fetch values for each of the 16 directions are multiplied with the average wind speed in the given direction. \n\nThe model has been run by NIVA for the whole Norwegian coast, and has been used as part of the habitat modelling of the National program for mapping biodiversity \u2013 coast (Bekkby et al. 2013). The model has also been applied in several research projects in Norway (e.g. Bekkby et al. 2008, 2009, 2014, 2015, Bekkby \u0026 Moy 2011, Norderhaug et al. 2012, 2014, Pedersen et al. 2012, Rinde et al. 2014). The model has also been run for Sweden (e.g. Eriksson et al. 2004), Finland (Is\u00e6us \u0026 Rygg 2005), the Danish region of the Skagerrak coast and the Russian, Latvian, Estonian, Lithuanian and German territories of the Baltic Sea (Wijkmark \u0026 Is\u00e6us 2010). The wave exposure values range from Ultra sheltered to Extremely exposed (cf Wijkmark \u0026 Is\u00e6us 2010, similar to the EUNIS system of Davies \u0026 Moss 2004)."}, {"color": "orange", "id": 1985, "label": "_:N26dff1ce416f47ca96933e3bc46d451a", "shape": "dot", "size": 40, "title": "_:N26dff1ce416f47ca96933e3bc46d451a"}, {"color": "orange", "id": 1986, "label": "_:Nf41596d726ed4a4c92a7046d633ac0d3", "shape": "dot", "size": 40, "title": "_:Nf41596d726ed4a4c92a7046d633ac0d3"}, {"id": 1987, "label": "sub10ssag", "shape": "dot", "title": "sub10ssag"}, {"id": 1988, "label": "ef885394-a264-4855-b086-c4c8233e48fa", "shape": "dot", "title": "ef885394-a264-4855-b086-c4c8233e48fa"}, {"id": 1989, "label": "lorhnephrh", "shape": "dot", "title": "lorhnephrh"}, {"id": 1990, "label": "EP_SDN_MED_PSAL_Climatology.1.1 - Mediterranean Sea Salinity Climatology V1.1", "shape": "dot", "title": "EP_SDN_MED_PSAL_Climatology.1.1 - Mediterranean Sea Salinity Climatology V1.1"}, {"id": 1991, "label": "2013 Natural England Verification Survey of Intertidal Sediments within the Thanet Coast rMCZ", "shape": "dot", "title": "2013 Natural England Verification Survey of Intertidal Sediments within the Thanet Coast rMCZ"}, {"color": "orange", "id": 1992, "label": "_:N0c5dcf5fbb574f67971d622c3f075004", "shape": "dot", "size": 40, "title": "_:N0c5dcf5fbb574f67971d622c3f075004"}, {"id": 1993, "label": "EMODnet Physics - Collection of Saildrone Gulf Stream 2019 Near-Real-Time Mission Data", "shape": "dot", "title": "EMODnet Physics - Collection of Saildrone Gulf Stream 2019 Near-Real-Time Mission Data"}, {"color": "orange", "id": 1994, "label": "_:Na9d5c7ad9f9d4a8085f841576da9feeb", "shape": "dot", "size": 40, "title": "_:Na9d5c7ad9f9d4a8085f841576da9feeb"}, {"id": 1995, "label": "EWCT", "shape": "dot", "title": "EWCT"}, {"id": 1996, "label": "\npmel_co2_moorings_7036_cf9d_0b0a\n", "shape": "dot", "title": "\npmel_co2_moorings_7036_cf9d_0b0a\n"}, {"id": 1997, "label": "The objective of this project was to generate seabed habitat maps for locations with full coverage acoustic datasets to as detailed a hierarchical level as possible within the Marine Habitat Classification for Britain and Ireland (version 04.05), also known as MNCR classification, (Connor et al. 2004).

Fish species have been grouped into EUMOFA\u0027s aggregations such as Commodity Groups (CG) and Main Commercial Species (MCS). For each fish species in each place of sale, volume (net weight in kg), value (Euro) and price (Euro/kg) are provided on a monthly basis by year of reference, CG, MCS and country. The dataset also includes information on fish presentation (e.g. whole, headed, gutted, etc.) and preservation state (e.g. fresh, frozen, etc.). Information on presentation and preservations state are also retrieved from EUMOFA. The geographical coverage of data is: Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK. The dataset is updated twice a year. It covers a time series from 2007 to January 2019 (not complete). The EUMOFA is a fully-fledged observatory, but is also a work in progress: its coverage may be extended in the future.Compared with the previous version, this new version of the dataset includes an update to January 2019 (for the countries which sent their data to EUMOFA), information down to species level (ERS code), as well as information on size."}, {"id": 5677, "label": "In situ gridded Sea Surface Currents as monitored by High Frequency Radars", "shape": "dot", "title": "In situ gridded Sea Surface Currents as monitored by High Frequency Radars"}, {"id": 5678, "label": "Output of the 2019 EUSeaMap broad-scale predictive model, produced by EMODnet Seabed Habitats.\n\nThe extent of the mapped area includes the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Baltic Sea, and areas of the North Eastern Atlantic extending from the Canary Islands in the south to the Barents Sea in the north.\n\nThe map was produced using a \"top-down\" modelling approach using classified habitat descriptors to determine a final output habitat.\n\nHabitat descriptors differ per region but include:\n    Biological zone\n    Energy class\n    Oxygen regime\n    Salinity regime\n    Seabed substrate\n    Riverine input\n\nHabitat descriptors (excepting Substrate) are calculated using underlying physical data and thresholds derived from statistical analyses or expert judgement on known conditions.\n\nThe model is produced using R and Arc Model Builder (10.1). \n\nThe model was created using raster input layers with a cell size of 0.00104dd (roughly 100 metres).
