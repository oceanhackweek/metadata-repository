Both EEA\u0027s datasets have been filtered by Cogea to show only maritime areas and sites (i.e. areas entirely at sea), and coastal areas and sites(internal areas that intersect and/or are tangent, using 1 km buffer, to the marine regions and subregions geographic boundaries shapefile, available at https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/msfd-regions-and-subregions). The CDDA dataset cover the whole EU in the case of Natura 2000 data. In the case of CDDA, geographical coverage of GIS vector boundary data is: Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo under UNSC Resolution 1244/99, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom.

This work  produced habitat maps of the seabed using novel predictive modelling techniques. This dataset is related to the predictive modelling only. The HABMAP Extension Project has built on the methods developed during the original project, and has repeated the modelling work using higher resolution / improved input datasets to help increase the accuracy of the predictive map outputs. The modelling work has also been extended to cover all of Welsh waters (previously cut-off at the Interreg funding boundary), notably including the Dee and Severn estuaries.  The purpose of this data capture was to provide seabed habitat maps that could be used for conservation and management. Project outputs might be used in strategic planning, decision making for offshore developments, Marine Protected Area selection, sensitivity mapping and mapping essential fish habitats. However, because of the way the  has been produced, and the fact that some data has been modelled and derived, the maps are not appropriate to act as the sole evidence for any specific planning or regulatory decision or assessment without further supporting studies or evidence.\nThe project boundaries were as follows: Southern Irish Sea- land-based boundaries include the whole Welsh coast to the English border on the east side of the Dee Estuary in the north, and the whole Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel coastline in the south, extending as far as Morte Point (east of Ifracombe) in England.

This work  produced habitat maps of the seabed using novel predictive modelling techniques. This dataset is related to the predictive modelling only. The HABMAP Extension Project has built on the methods developed during the original project, and has repeated the modelling work using higher resolution / improved input datasets to help increase the accuracy of the predictive map outputs. The modelling work has also been extended to cover all of Welsh waters (previously cut-off at the Interreg funding boundary), notably including the Dee and Severn estuaries.  The purpose of this data capture was to provide seabed habitat maps that could be used for conservation and management. Project outputs might be used in strategic planning, decision making for offshore developments, Marine Protected Area selection, sensitivity mapping and mapping essential fish habitats. However, because of the way the  has been produced, and the fact that some data has been modelled and derived, the maps are not appropriate to act as the sole evidence for any specific planning or regulatory decision or assessment without further supporting studies or evidence.\nThe project boundaries were as follows: Southern Irish Sea- land-based boundaries include the whole Welsh coast to the English border on the east side of the Dee Estuary in the north, and the whole Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel coastline in the south, extending as far as Morte Point (east of Ifracombe) in England.

Additionally the seabed \u00ab Carte G \u00bb from the French hydrographic survey (SHOM) was used in the interpretation process.\nIn the tidal zone the identification was made by interpreting coastal ortho-photographs from BD Ortho (2005 et 2009) and digitising them on scale 1 : 2000\u00e8me with further qualification of the polygons based on ground truth data.\nThe compilation comprises the following various data sources.\nLamarche S., Bajjouk T., 2013.

Samples were sieved at 0.5mm and all invertebrates enumerated and biomass estimated by wet weight by species. \n      \n     Chichester Harbour was characterised by mud habitats in the upper reaches with sand shores to the south of Thorney Island and near to the harbour mouth.  Algal mats were recorded in the upper reaches of the harbour, notably Bosham Channel, where seagrass was also present but extensive beds were only discovered recorded from the southwestern corner of the harbour.  Fauna in the muddy areas was dominated by oligochaetes and cirratulid polychaetes especially Tubificoides benedii and Tharyx killariensis as well as the small gastropod Hydrobia ulvae.

Surveys were carried out on foot where the intertidal area was small and/or firm underfoot and from a hovercraft where soft sediments were present. \n      \n     Target notes and photographs of visible flora and fauna were supplemented with 0.01m2 core samples consisting of five faunal replicates and a further one for particle size analysis (PSA), as well as 1m2 quadrats dug out to 20cm to aid biotope classification.  Samples were sieved at 0.5mm and all invertebrates enumerated and biomass estimated by wet weight by species. \n      \n     Chichester Harbour was characterised by mud habitats in the upper reaches with sand shores to the south of Thorney Island and near to the harbour mouth.  Algal mats were recorded in the upper reaches of the harbour, notably Bosham Channel, where seagrass was also present but extensive beds were only discovered recorded from the southwestern corner of the harbour.  Fauna in the muddy areas was dominated by oligochaetes and cirratulid polychaetes especially Tubificoides benedii and Tharyx killariensis as well as the small gastropod Hydrobia ulvae.  In sandy areas, the fauna was characterised by the lugworm Arenicola marina, the orbiniid polychaete Scoloplos armiger and tanaid crustaceans. \n      \n     Langstone Harbour was also characterised by mud habitats almost throughout the entire area but with some areas of coarse mixed sediment on the upper shore which supported a wide variety of macroalgae but which also showed signs of bait digging.  Algal mats were much more prevalent in Langstone Harbour than in Chichester Harbour but seagrass was also much more extensive.  The fauna of the samples from Langstone Harbour was very similar to that of Chichester Harbour with a numerical dominance of cirratulids, oligochaetes and Hydrobia ulvae. \n      \n     In Southampton Water, there was a greater mix of habitats from tide-swept coarse sediment to fine silt and clay.  The tide-swept gravels and pebble at the mouth of the Hamble Estuary supported a diverse assemblage of macroalgae and epifauna which included ascidians, barnacles, bivalves and sponges.  Within the Hamble Estuary itself, there were very soft fine sediments which supported cockles but there were also thick algal mats which supported large numbers of Hydrobia ulvae but caused anoxia at the mud surface.  Soft, fine sediments were also encountered on the western side of Southampton Water from Calshot to Hythe with a fauna dominated by Tharyx killariensis but with large numbers of cockles and Hydrobia ulvae near Calshot itself. \n      \n     On the seaward side of Calshot, to western side of the Beaulieu Estuary, there were coarse mixed sediments which supported ephemeral algae, small actiniarians, and a rich fauna of polychaetes, amphipods and molluscs.  There was also a large seagrass bed on the lower shore at Calshot and evidence of bait digging in these areas, particularly at Lepe Beach.  Within the Beaulieu and Lymington Estuaries the habitats were fine, soft sediments with a similar fauna to the mud areas of Chichester and Langstone Harbours but with a greater prevalence of ragworm and tellins. \n      \n     The north coast of the Isle of Wight was characterised by protrusions of clay and outcrops of bedrock which supported piddocks and a rich crustacean fauna as well as a variety of macroalgae predominantly fucoids.  In addition, the habitats of Thorness Bay included mixed coarse sediment supporting barnacles and littorinids and sand supporting sand mason worms and small patches of seagrass beds.

For more details about this methodology see documents such as the EUSeaMap 1 final report (Cameron and Askew, 2011), Coltman et al., 2008, or Vasquez et al., 2015\nThe model was created using raster input layers with a cell size of 0.002dd (roughly 250 meters). The model includes the sublittoral zone only; due to the high variability of the littoral zone, a lack of detailed substrate data and the resolution of the model, it is difficult to predict littoral habitats at this scale.\nThe map follows the EUNIS 2007-11 classification system, supplemented by additional categories in deep sea areas and in areas lacking full data.\n\nReferences:\nCameron, A., Askew, N.

In addition, intertidal sediment cores were taken at 16 stations (0.01m2 cores 3 replicates at each station) distributed throughout the Cumbria Coast rMCZ at the low, mid and high shore, in order to assess the benthic species present, along with an additional sample for Particle Size Analysis. Samples were sieved over a 0.5mm sieve. Sediment scrape samples were also taken at 4 stations at the midshore for Tributyl tin, heavy metal and organic contaminant analysis. The Phase II quantitative survey of intertidal rocky reefs comprised of 9 quadrat sites per transect with 3 replicate quadrats at each low, mid and upper shore zone or the main biotope present. Percentage cover of species present within each 0.25m2  quadrat was recorded. The methods used for data collection and processing followed protocols and standards for biotope mapping and sampling.

This limit was digitalized with the use of the bathymetry layer\n- Upper slope lower limit: depth 750m\n- Upper bathyal lower limit: depth 1100m\n- Mid bathyal lower limit: depth 1800m\n- Lower bathyal lower limit: break of slope due to the entrance into the abyssal plain. This limit was digitalized with the use of the bathymetry layer\nDeep biological zones (from upper slope to abyssal) were chosen according to the classification proposed by Howell (2010).\n\nFor more detail see Vasquez et al.
